## Notes

### AI Implementation Strategy (2027)

The AI integration is planned for 2027 to allow:
1. **Cost reduction** - Serverless GPU pricing will likely decrease
2. **Model improvements** - Better small models (sub-4B parameters) with higher quality
3. **Infrastructure maturity** - More stable on-demand GPU providers
4. **User base growth** - More users to justify the investment

**Proposed Architecture:**
```
User → Cloudflare Worker → Modal.com (Serverless GPU)
                              ↓
                         Phi-3 / Llama 4 Mini / Future Model
                              ↓
                         Auto-shutdown after idle
```

**Budget Estimate:** $30-50/month for light-moderate usage with auto-scaling.
