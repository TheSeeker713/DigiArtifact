// Auth route removed — PIN-based authentication has been deprecated and removed.
// The legacy `handleAuthLogin` route used PINs for authentication and was a security risk.
// If you need a replacement auth flow, use OAuth or an email/token based login.
// The source file has been intentionally left as a non-operative placeholder to avoid accidental reintroduction.
